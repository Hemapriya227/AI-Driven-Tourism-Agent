# ITERA | The Self-Healing Travel Orchestrator

**ITERA** is an AI-driven Tourism Agent Planner that eliminates the "Planning Tax" through 
autonomous, multi-agent orchestration. Unlike static travel tools, ITERA manages the 
entire lifecycle of a trip—from initial discovery to real-time, dynamic re-routing.

### 🚀 Key Innovations
- **Agentic Squad:** A collaborative framework of specialized agents (Logistics, Sourcing, 
  and Monitor) that negotiate travel constraints in real-time.
- **TOON Protocol:** A proprietary **Typed Object-Oriented Notation** that reduces LLM 
  token consumption by up to 60%, slashing latency and inference costs.
- **Self-Healing Logic:** Real-world sensor integration (Weather/Transit APIs) that 
  autonomously adjusts itineraries to handle unforeseen circumstances.
